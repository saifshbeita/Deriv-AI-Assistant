##  About

**Deriv AI: Asset Insight Engine** is a focused intelligence tool designed to answer one simple question: *"How does the world look right now for [Insert Asset]?"*

Retail traders often stare at charts in isolation, missing the wider global context driving price action. This engine bridges that gap. By ingesting **real-time market news** and applying deep asset-class reasoning, it breaks down exactly how current global events are impacting specific assets (e.g., BTC, Gold, EUR/USD).

Instead of reckless "buy/sell" signals, it creates a high-level **Risk Profile**, helping traders understand the "Why" behind the market moves.

###  Key Features

* ** Real-Time Relevance:** The core logic is driven by live market narratives, ensuring analysis is relevant to the exact second.
* ** Laser Focus:** Analyzes specific tickers (e.g., `BTC`, `XAU`, `NVDA`) rather than generic market commentary.
* ** Institutional Reasoning:** Detects complex correlations (e.g., how rising bond yields specifically impact Tech stocks vs. Forex).
* ** Safe & Compliant:** Explicitly trained to avoid "Financial Advice," focusing purely on risk exposure and educational insight.

    * **Key News Driver:** The specific headline moving the needle.
    * **Exposure:** Volatility warning level.
